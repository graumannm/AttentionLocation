# AttentionLocation

This repository contains the analysis code that goes with the manuscript [Independent spatiotemporal effects of spatial attention and background clutter on human object location representations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.02.490141v1).

The fMRI and EEG data can be downloaded [here](https://osf.io/hf6zp/).

## Requirements

- Matlab software
- The code depends on functions from the [libsvm-3.11 toolbox](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/), but these are provided in the folder /Code/LibsvmFunctions, thus no installation of the toolbox is required.

## Start analysis and plot result

To run the demo, simply run the script run_analysis.m in the main folder.

Please be aware that results can differ slightly from time to time because of the random assignment of trials to training and testing bins.
